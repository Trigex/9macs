# â‘¨macs

It's basically [Witchmacs](https://github.com/snackon/Witchmacs) with bits ripped out, and stuff thrown on. 

This repo basically only exists for ease of syncing with my laptop, but figured why not let peruse my abortion that is attempts at Elisp!

## Install (Don't)

`git clone https://github.com/trigex/-9-macs ~/.emacs.d` and then running emacs oughta do. Make sure you install the [JetBrains Mono Font](https://download.jetbrains.com/fonts/JetBrainsMono-1.0.0.zip) before hand, it'll yell at you otherwise.

Once it's up and runnning, also execute `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts`, from there should all be fine. Bask in the Cirno. Then close Emacs because you don't really know how to open a file.
